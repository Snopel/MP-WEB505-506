					<h3>Art Tour Cancelled...</h3>
					<p>
						Greetings all, <br/><br/>
						Unfortunately due to the recent Chrismtas lockdown, we have decided it is no longer safe to host our planned
						Australia tour. <br/>
						It is probably best that we wait until this virus calms down to a long streak of 0 case days before we think about
						working the times out again, as we want this to be a free event and do not want to lose any more funding if it will
						be canceled again. <br/>
						<br/>
						On the behalf of the SnopelNet team, we apologise for the inconvenience and disappointment and will endeavour to 
						roll this fantastic event out again once it is deemed safe.<br/>
						We thank you for your patience and your support.
					</p>

					<h3>Surprise Soiree was a success!</h3>
					<figure class = "imgright">
						<img id = "soiree" src = "images/soiree.png"/>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Greetings all,<br/><br/>
						We at the SnopelNet team would like to thank each and every one of you for your support in our sudden soiree event at the
						rural town of Wallan, VIC. We would also like to personally thank the regional college for allowing us to conduct such
						a wonderful event for the VCE students who were struggling with their studies during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/>
						We thought this would be a nice way to lift the spirits of these troubled young minds and ease their worries with some
						good old fashioned music therapy!<br/>
						The turnout was a lot more wholesome than we expected and once again, we would like to thank you for joining us in
						lending a hand to these youths in this horrible time.<br/>
						<br/>
						We hope all who showed up enjoyed the performance!
