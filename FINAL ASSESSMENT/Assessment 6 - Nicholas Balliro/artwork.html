					<h2>Digital Vector Art</h2>
					<p>
						Below are some digital vector pieces created by Snopel from when he was younger to his current age.

						<dt>The Vessel and the Moth</dt>
							<dd>
								One of the most popular works from Snopel, this piece is also SnopelNet's title card.
								It portrays two of his favourite series: Pokemon and Hollow Knight. He thought it was
								interesting how The Radiance, the final encounter of Hollow Knight, looked an awful
								lot like Frosmoth from Pokemon's Generation 8 series, and decided to pit them both
								together in harmony fully incorporating two of his greatest enjoyments into one
								serene and exciting picture.

						<dt>Four Elements</dt>
							<dd>
								This particular work was actually Snopel's very first drawing and the beginning of his
								digital vector art journey! In his Year 12 class of 2014, he created this combination of
								elemental beings from Pokemon into a split-dimension piece which was designed to be displayed
								as four separate A2 canvases around 2cm apart from each other to show that they are all connected,
								although in different spaces. Behind each elemental is the japanese kanji symbol for their respective
								element embroidered in their effect to add depth and polish off his final year of education with a
								dazzling display of colour.

								Wishing to attempt a line-free approach to an artwork, Snopel designed this piece to have a clean
								and simplified effect through nothing but colour contrast and a simple background. This piece
								portrays two moth beings of opposite elements, Fire and Ice, finding harmony in one another through
								similarity. These are recognised as two Pokemon who were remarkably similar in the series and are two
								of his favourites, hence wishing to pair the two in a work befitting of the beauty and extravagance
								of the pair of contradicting yet serene embodiments.
