			<h2>About Us</h2>
		
			<p>
				<!-- Span is used to fomat a singular line, as opposed to Div which is usually for a whole set -->
				<span id="callout">Lakeland Reeds</span> is an ideal place to unplug from your daily routine, whether on the shore of Twin <br/>
				Lakes watching the sunset over the cattails, or just curled up in a hammock on our wraparound porch <br/>
				with a good book. Breakfast is ready whenever you are, and we're happy to accommodate a wide range of <br/>
				appetites, from comfort food,like sausage and biscuits, to the lighter end of things, such as egg white <br/>
				omelettes and fresh fruit.
			</p>
			<p>
				We're here to help you get the most out of your time with us, from canoes and life vests for a day out <br/>
				on the lake, to popcorn and a DVD of <span class="name">The Wizard of Oz</span> for a quiet evening in. <br/>
				We look forward to welcoming you!
