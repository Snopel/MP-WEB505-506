In 1972, Torontoite Jan Mercutio returned home from a trip to Chicago

by three words she'd scrawled on her calendar during her trip:

he soon began inviting friends over to sample the results of
 her tests. Her friends clearly enjoyed what she whipped up, 
as they were soon asking to come to dinner in numbers 
that threatened to overwhelm her. Wanting to accommodate 
the hunger she'd fed, though, Jan put her head to figuring 
out how to make her pizza more widely available. In 1974, 
she opened the first Big J's Deep Dish Pizza restaurant on St. 
Joseph St., and local residents and visitors alike have continued 
to join the ranks of her fans ever since.

Jan has added two locations and expanded Big J's menu
 to include salads and calzones, while continuing to serve 
pizza worth travelling for in a comfortable, friendly setting. 
Big J's Pizza has been awarded the "Best Pizza" distinction by the 
Toronto Times reader survey a total of 5 times. We invite 
you to come by one of our locations and find out what all 
the excitement is about.
