			<h1>Murfreesboro Regional Soccer League</h1>
			<h2>Part of North American Recreational Soccer Association</h2>
			
			<p>
				The MRSL is open to players of all levels who want to play soccer in a relaxed, friendly <br/>
				environment. Even if you've never played soccer before, the MRSL is a great place to start.<br/>
				<br/>
				To get a feel for our league, we recommend you call us at the number below or stop by Davies <br/>
				Sporting Goods to talk to one or our coordinators and get the details on our next all-team practice or <br/>
				workshop day. Then come kick around the ball with us and meet other players in the league.<br/>
				<br/>
				If you're interested in joining up, you'll need to complete some paperwork and pay $65 for a <br/>
				seasonal membership ($40 for seniors and students).<br/>
				<br/>
				We look forward to seeing you on the field!
